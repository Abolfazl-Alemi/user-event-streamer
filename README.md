# user-event-streamer
A Golang-based service that streams user event data. The service listens for events on a UDP port, parses the incoming data, and efficiently pushes it to a Kafka topic for further processing. Designed for high-throughput environments, this tool ensures seamless integration of user events into Kafka pipelines for real-time analytics and processing.
